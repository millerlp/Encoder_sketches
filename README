These are a set of Arduino sketches to test reading motor encoder pulse counting.
I am testing these against a Pololu 37D gear reduction electric motor with a 
64-count-per-revolution encoder on the motor armature. 

Unfortunately at this time, it seems like every version of these sketches misses the
occasional encoder pulse.
